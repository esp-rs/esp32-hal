# esp32-hal

⚠️  **NOTE** this HAL is now in maintenence mode only, and will be archived when we have ported all drivers to the new multichip HAL: [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal)

A hardware abstraction layer for the [esp32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) written in Rust.

## Running examples

There are currently two ways to flash the esp32:

  * The `flash` script using `esptool` 
    - If you are familiar with the esp ecosystem, there is a `flash` script in this repo which utilizes the espressif esptool to flash the esp32 over usb.
    Example usage:
     ```rust
        ./flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -e blinky --release
     ```
  
  * The [`espflash`](https://github.com/icewind1991/espflash) cargo subcommand
    - A Rust rewrite of the esptool, with a cargo subcommand. Example usage:
     ```rust
        cargo espflash --example blinky --release /dev/ttyUSB0
     ```
